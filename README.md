# Library Management Web Application

## Spring project with mySQL database

### 
App is meant to manage theoritical library. It has to be easy to use for readers and librarians. I developed it for Networks Technologies course at WrocÅ‚aw University of Technology and Science. It is my first backend app in Spring.

### App's funcionalities:
* login / register with encoded passwords
* JWT token authentication
* add/ delete/ update books in library, users (readers), reviews, book details and loans
* loan books (there is fixed limit of books that can be borrowed)
* give reviews (user can only give one review per book)
* add details to books (librarians (ROLE_MODERATOR) can add reviews)

### Requirements to run app:
* (under development)

### Future improvements:
* google books API connection to feed Book and BookDetails entities in my DB with apropriate data
* change email/password for user
* there will be frontend element developed in near future

### (Library Management Web Application is under developement)
